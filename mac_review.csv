Apple sent my MacBook Pro with NO INSTRUCTIONS. Horrible customer service.,One person found this helpful,Bruce W.,-,1,2020-05-22T11:59:17,The Apple MacBook Pro looks great and  based on all the reviews  it probably is. However  as a 71 year old man  accustomed to using Windows for the past 12 years  this new MacBook Pro was very different. The part of it that really makes me angry is the fact that it came with NO INSTRUCTIONS. I need something to look at and do things  step by step. It started off with a Voice tutorial thing that was as confusing and ridiculous as anything I ve ever seen. Trying to access the  guide  on my cell phone while trying to set up this MacBook was as frustrating as anything I ve ever attempted. For a big company  like Apple  to fail so miserably at KEEPING IT SIMPLE  is a horrible error. I will struggle through this but I m not happy about how difficult this is for me. Some clearly written instructions  included with the machine  would have been nice.
Unix-Based Stability  Unparalleled Performance / $  and a Bright  Beautiful Display,3 people found this helpful,Clarkb286,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,The performance of this machine (CPU  memory  SSD  and GPU speed) is outstanding. The battery lasts over 10x longer than my previous laptop  a Lenovo Thinkpad T490. The display is bright (500 nits) and beautiful. The laptop is ultra-portable  weighing less than 3 lbs. Either the cooling fans on this laptop are so quiet that they re inaudible  or else they ve never come on! macOS Big Sur is intuitive and feature-rich  and the fact that the OS is based on Unix makes software development a delight. The only criticism that I have with this machine is that it only has 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports; an external USB-C hub/adapter/dongle is required if one needs HDMI  USB-A  Ethernet  SDHC  DisplayPort  or VGA connectivity. The price / performance of the M1 MacBook Pro is hard to beat!
Great Apple quality and very compact.,One person found this helpful,Bob D,-,5,2020-03-19T13:59:17,A nice  lightweight computer with beautiful screen and nice sounding audio speakers. Battery life is awesome.Only negatives are:1. I miss the mag charge connector  this USB-C seems flimsy and not durable.2. ZERO ports! You ll need a side port product like the Cheotech or others if you want to add accessories.
Touch Bar is clutch,3 people found this helpful,Katrina,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,The Touch Bar on this Mac book makes writing so much easier. It has predictive text and know what you re trying to say. It saves passwords by your fingerprint. If you are an Apple person like me you can unlock your max book from your Apple Watch. The battery life on this is amazing. I m on it hours at a time and hardly ever have to charge it. Great Apple product.Keeps my life on track as I m a busy teacher and parent and travel for my other job!
Perfect for photo editing,One person found this helpful,PhiliptheGreat,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,I was impressed that there was no lagging when photo editing it. I switched from PC to Apple which might take some adjustment. If you re like me  I recommend that you watch some YouTube videos on some handy tips.The only thing that irritated me was that the package was left on the doorstep for hours. Nobody signed for it. I shuddered to think what might happened if it got stolen. Definitely worth investing Nest or Ring door bell even if nothing got stolen.
Fantastic,2 people found this helpful,Corey W.,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,It has been a long time since I bought a computer  but we were in desperate need of something for the entire family to be able to use. I opted for the pro with a larger hard drive just for a bit of extra storage. This laptop is fast and offers a lot of options for software.
The hype is justified,-,WSSizer,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,I ve had the new M1 MacBook Pro for several months now  and I have to say that it lives up to all of the superlative reviews it received. As expected  the most noticeable improvement is its speed  which is in another league from my 2012 Mac. Battery life is excellent  and the automatic day/night screen change works very well. Although some prefer the standard control bar on the MacBook Air  I think the automatic control bar on the new Pro is really neat. I also like the larger touch pad on the Pro vs the one on the Air. All things considered  the new MacBook Pro is a great value  especially at the Amazon sale price.
Overpriced Old Laptop,7 people found this helpful,anon,-,1,2020-05-15T12:59:17,Only 100$ off 6 months after release. Charging too much for old technology. no touch screen
Surprisingly long battery life and cool operation,3 people found this helpful,Howard Woodward,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,You can read about the new features of the 2020 MacBook Pro with Apple s new M1 chip online. It is living-up to my high expectations. Out of the box  the initial start-up was flawless  downloading all my Contacts and documents from the Cloud  linking to Internet  and upgrading to MacOS 11.1.
Impressed,One person found this helpful,DM29,-,5,2020-04-17T17:59:17,I ve been a lifelong user of Windows PC and Linux. Until Big Sur and the M1 chip came out I ve been hesitant to try Macs  so I first got my toes wet by getting an iPhone 12 earlier this year (also a long time Android user). Having used an iPhone for over 6 months now and being very pleased by its performance I felt encouraged to try one of these new MacBooks  and let me tell you  it did not let me down.I think the level of thinking and detail that went into designing this device is out of this world. You have to give credit where credit is due: this is the most well designed high performance laptop I ve ever used.10/10 would recommend.
Simply the Best!,4 people found this helpful,Steven James DeBlasi,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,This is my very first Mac. It was the value for the price (strange to describe an Apple product that way) and the performance of Apple s new M1 chip that finally compelled me to buy my first Mac. And I m glad I did. This machine is awesome. It s my baby now. It s so good! Part of it no doubt is the novelty is using MacOS instead of Windows 10  but I really love my new MacBook Pro!
Very good -- but not up to the hype,2 people found this helpful,Brian S in DC,-,3,2020-08-06T12:59:17,I ve been an Apple user for over 35 years  and I was pretty excited to make the M1 migration now that many apps have been updated for Apple Silicon. I expected to be blown away  and while this is an excellent Apple laptop  and the battery life does live up to the hype  I overall I found it disappointing compared to the reviews. Three things:1. Sure  it may fly if you re doing really CPU heavy things  but for things like  heavy  productivity  I found it no better than my Intel 16 . In fact....2. This could be related to all the stories I read saying   8GB on Apple Silicon is like 16GB on Intel.  Yeah  don t believe those. Again  this may be true for tasks that are well suited for ARM  but heavy productivity work is no better. I keep a decent but not insane amount of Safari tabs open at any time  and that plus having much of anything else open kept the memory pressure graph constantly in the yellow  if not red. And that may or may not be related to the biggest problem which is....3. I had significant problems using my LG 5K display which has worked like a champ with my 16 . Sometimes it would take up to 4 minutes before things  settled down  and I was actually able to use the computer again. That was a dealbreaker.Would 2 and 3 have been better with more memory  or are these M1 growing pains  or something else? I don t know. I ll probably give the 16  a try with 16GB whenever it comes out. For now  this 13  was just too underpowered for my fairly average professional needs.I realize that reviews below 5 stars on this are rare  which I find puzzling for the reasons above. Hope this is helpful to anyone who might be wondering about the downsides.
The best laptop around with longest battery,3 people found this helpful,Maurice Rivera,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,Apple hit it out of the park with the new M1 chip. It outperforms I7 laptop from a year ago by a long shot. Plus outperforms most while having a over 12 hour battery life. I not no Apple fan  but this laptop is great. Plus they finally got rid of the dreaded butterfly keyboard that would fail even when we ll taken care of and when back to the older but mature scissor keyboard design. The screen is accurate  if your looking to upgrade. This is the one to get  or even go with the base model with out touch bar and still will outperform the intel macs and other laptops  while having the best power management on any laptop seen to date  while at a finally reasonable price.
I love it!!,One person found this helpful,Charlotte B.,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,Starting in the early 2000 s I became a strictly Apple girl for all electronic devices. I love the easy integration between devices and as a person with a disability it means a lot to have that interconnect-ability. I previously had a Macbook Pro from 2015 and it was malfunctioning badly. The replacement cost exceeded its value so invested that repair cost into this Macbook Pro. it s come a long way since 2015! I love how light weight it is  I swear it s lighter than my Macbook Air from 2010 was. I like the touch display but I mainly only use it for emojis 🙂. I had Big Sur on my previous Mac but it ran slow. This Macbook works so much faster than what I had before. The screen is brilliant and gorgeous. I had read this Macbook could run any app on my phone. The reality is it s only a few apps. What I wanted to work the most was Instagram  and that does not work on this. There are several apps though and that s a nice feature.I m not techie from a hardware position but I am an advanced user from a software perspective and I am really happy with this this.
Only one external display!,12 people found this helpful,david boll,-,1,2020-03-19T13:59:17,Apple took a big step back on this one! Beware… This M1 computer only serves one remote display.
Just wow,3 people found this helpful,Earth22BoundX,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1C765-V+CS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,This is my first Mac ever and it doesn t even compare to my Asus. The speakers are very loud and the touch bar is a great addition. This is definitely a very fast and ver powerful machine
Did not work,7 people found this helpful,Sherman Smith,-,1,2020-03-25T17:59:17,I am a big fan of MacBooks. This was my fourth one in the past 10 years. This one was a LEMON. It worked fine at first but began to freeze on booting. Called Apple three times and walked thorough reloading the IOS and erasing the entire system to reinstall. It then went black screen. Took it to the Apple store and was told in two minutes to send it back. Tried to exchange it for another but apparently you don t have more in stock. Still a fan but sometimes you get a LEMON and are unable to make lemonade.
It's a good upgrade from my old MacBook Pro,One person found this helpful,Amazon Customer in Raleigh  NC,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,I have an aging MacBook Pro (15 ) which I use a great deal. At some point I know it will cease to function well  so I made the leap to the smaller 2020 MacBook Pro (13 ) with the M1 chip. It runs fast  stays cool  and after a month or so of pretty constant usage  has been doing beautifully. Some of the newer features like the touch screen pad have taken me some time to get used to  but I m learning to appreciate them. A word of caution...not all apps and software are quite ready for the M1 chip / Big Sur yet. I m still straddling the world of two MacBooks  the older one running High Sierra and the new one running Big Sur  because some of the apps don t work perfectly on the new MacBook. But all in all  it s a good transition for me.
elegant and powerful,5 people found this helpful,joshua m.,-,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I have 3 Macbook pros and they are all pretty old. Mac lasts!! This laptop is absolutely amazing. Its fast  sleek  and has helpful and timesaving features. Probably one of my more favorite purchases in a long time.
HEAVY eye fatigue.,One person found this helpful,Benjie,-,3,2020-06-27T11:59:17,Good MacBook. I owned a 2013 prior to this and vowed to get macbooks for their superior performance.I rated this a 4 because I had some eye strain which was of great irritance. However I just turned off the True Colors and changed the background to a softer color. Problem solved.I also didn t appreciate that now it uses a USB-C type dock. So now I have to get new adapters and wires to connect it s Thunderbolt 3 to other devices). It took me a good three weeks to figure everything out.Despite this I love the sound and picture quality. The touch bar is cool too.** UPDATE after 3 months of useI can t handle the heavy eye fatigue caused from this new macbook. To be honest  I think my vision got worst after using this mac. I m a teacher  so I must look at my screen a lot. Comparing it to another macbook that I owned (a MacBook pro 2013 which I got replaced with this M1)  I got very little eye fatigue from it. Also the design doesn t work if you add a case to it. A case would prevent you to effectively use the USB c ports as the bottom part of a case would interfere with it.
Best Laptop in History,895 people found this helpful,JK Reviews,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed  looks  weight/size  display  and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color  the new keyboard  the Touch Bar  and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today  but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking  so after a TON of research  I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks  and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store  who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop  umm  do you have an appointment? Well  you re going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store . I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook  but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean  seriously  do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway  in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more)  the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it s not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing  blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water  and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes  256 ssd is standard - that s what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now  you don t really need to keep much on the laptop drive  you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I ve been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.
A Marked Improvement Over Intel MacBooks,711 people found this helpful,Ian,-,5,2020-08-13T14:59:17,I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such  Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed  battery life  and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks  plugins  software instruments  and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life  but it s not far off. This isn t a huge deal for me  as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available  but for someone who needs the portability  the difference is substantial.UPDATE 6/16/21: I have been using this laptop for over 6 months now on a daily basis. I have done everything from Word documents  email  web surfing  Logic Pro  Neural DSP guitar plugins  Adobe Lightroom  Adobe Illustrator  and many other tasks and I do not think that I have even heard the fan come on 1 time. It s pretty astounding. The M1 is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away. And while more and more apps become native to M1  I d expect performance to do nothing but improve.
MacBook Pro 13 with M1 chip  16 Gb memory,474 people found this helpful,AP,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.
Amazing,329 people found this helpful,Westmark Consulting,-,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7  My surface Book 3  my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great  the sound was superb  the screen bright  and it was blazing fast in all I did. I m an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

Good  but expensive,227 people found this helpful,Targaryen,-,2,2020-03-19T13:59:17,Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However  I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip  I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it s useless).Secondly  would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface  the MacBook turns off itself. I don t know what happened but I m pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also  I miss the MagSafe...

Everything I Expected-Except 1 Thing,221 people found this helpful,Kurt Luce,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,I m going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let s be honest  that s what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it s handheld products years ago.Not that I care  it s good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn t include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that  I have no issues. It s fast  efficient  reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it ll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

Regret Going M1,38 people found this helpful,Steve,-,1,2020-08-01T17:23:17,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can t get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.
Stick with the Intel-based Mac for now...,33 people found this helpful,mkidwel2,-,2,2020-02-22T16:59:17,I really wanted to love this laptop. I ve had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16  intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop s settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13  MacBook Pro. No issues  supports dual monitors  and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.
Best keyboard EVER,35 people found this helpful,J. Lopes,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,Coming from years and years of PC  I must say that this 13  M1 Macbook Pro is an Internet beast. I also use it for Lightroom  Photoshop  Affinity suite  Capture One  FL Studio and I have zero complaints. I hadn t had a mac since the mid 90 s and I was a huge fan then  but PC s just offer so much more for the money.The ports are an issue and you will need to buy a dock like device because you ll need it to hookup older devices or more than two devices at some point.GET THE 16GB model - While I have no issues with RAM so far  I believe the 16GB model should be the base model because the hibernation/sleep is going to kill the NAND hard drive eventually from writing to disk every time you close the lid.There is an issue with the keyboard that I haven t been able to replicate  but the delete key will enter a state where it doesn t work  though the keyboard still functions. I have to close whatever window I m typing in in order to get the delete key working again. It s not random  but I haven t figured out what two key combo is causing the problem or if it s just in twitter.The screen is 100% accurate (close enough) out of the box - The reason I got the macbook pro is because of the issues I was having with my 15  Dell XPS  which is a beast  color discrepancy when exporting. The colors were always over saturated and I had to guess what settings to use to counter the output. I did everything imaginable and always color calibrate with Spyder (for 10 years I ve done this) but the accuracy was never the same on other screens  printing or web postings.I never used the touch screen on the XPS. I hate smudged screens.THE BATTERY LIFE is insane  as you ve probably heard. 2 days  all day  no issues surfing the web at whatever levels are auto adjusted for on battery usage.The touchpad - While really good  there are times when the two finger scrolling skips around  but overall  is a good experience.I m not a fan of the operating system at all  just like iOS  it s just too clunky and cluttered. Something odd coming from a company who builds incredible hardware with fantastic esthetic designs.

This Macbook turned me away from Apple,30 people found this helpful,chris kaffer,-,2,2020-07-12T13:59:17,I am an Apple guy. I converted from PC ~ 2008 and have loved every apple device until the IPhone X and the new Macbook with M1 chip. Where to start? First  as is a major complaint for everyone  the Macbook pro has all of two ports (yes yes  I know  this was listed in the specs. It doesn t make it ok). If I need to be plugged in  I have 1 port remaining. It is incredibly idiotic that I have to buy a dock to expand my ports. Oh and the ports are only Thunderbolt in Apple s continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage. I did not buy a Mac Air for a reason  yet the Macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an Air. The new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense. The track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless. I have no bluetooth connectivity. I get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music. I see zero performance improvements with the M1chip. In fact  doing a side-by-side video recording with Quicktime (all parameters equalized) I have a severe lag with M1 Mac  but not with the Intel driven machine. And the touch bar is about the worst idea ever. I constantly dim the back light  or go back on web pages because of it. Absolute trash. I bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns  because that s how terrible it is. I will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming Macbook Pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed.So now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers.
Pinwheel of Death! M1 chipset a no go for me until they fix software!,30 people found this helpful,Mr. D,-,2,2020-09-25T15:59:17,Update 8/10/21A few updates now have made the pinwheel subside quite a bit  hope that future updates will make it go away for good.Previous:I constantly get the pinwheel when switching between programs I.E. Explorer  Outlook  Teams  amazon music  notes  etc. These are not high power requirement applications. It is especially bad when docking and undocking from my workstation. I have my previous MacBook Pro setup exactly like this model and it powers through without issues. The problem has gotten so bad that I have momentarily switched back to my previous one until Apple gets the software figured out with some updates. Disappointing!
First Apple,24 people found this helpful,Michael,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,Had Windows based computers since day one. Always something going on with them. I ve had at least 10 windows computers and decided it was time to try an Apple. Well I got to say I love this computer. A little bit of a learning curve but not a stumbling block. Don t let the 13” fool you. It s an awesome screen size and so sharp. I would recommend this computer to anyone.
Perfect!,26 people found this helpful,T123,-,5,2020-07-12T17:12:17,I don t normally write reviews  but since I spent $1500 on this MacBook Pro M1 13  from Amazon I have been very pleased. I have had it for less than a month and so far everything seems to be in perfect working order! I really love it to be honest. I was skeptical and a bit anxious about buying from Amazon instead of Apple directly  but I can say that there is no difference and it seems I got it $100 cheaper on Amazon and 2 day shipping. Just make sure it s sold and fulfilled by Amazon. All in all very pleased. For anyone on the fence about it you shouldn t be. Screen is bright  speakers are amazing  keyboard feels very nice  and battery is great!

Also not sure what its doing in there  but when I think my RAM is about to be all used up  I open up one more thing  and the RAM usage goes down..?!?! So confused  but I love it! The keyboard is amazing  as usual  and I actually enjoy the touch bar. I have read and heard complaints or people saying the touch bar is useless  but I use it all the time when I am editing videos and music. Even when I am messaging I love the emoji s are right there! It s an amazing laptop  for $1199.00 it is totally worth it. I did get an external SSD hard drive for more storage  but everything else is perfect. 8GB of unified RAM feels better than 16GB of normal RAM. If you re torn on that  do not worry about the RAM  you would have to be a big time movie editor to slow this thing down  MAYBE. Oh  and the battery life is crazy long! I don t have to charge it at all in a days worth of everything I do with it. And it s virtually noise free. I was going to wait for the 2021 model  but they postponed the date  and also informed that the M1X chip is only going to be on the higher priced models  which I wouldn t be getting anyway cuz I m not rich. You will love this  push Buy Now and smile!
Thanks to AMAZON i lost my job interview,18 people found this helpful,prashant,-,1,2020-06-26T14:59:17,So i got this item which was not working and had the camera going crazy with green lines all around. I asked amazon for getting a working laptop for my interview and they said we dont replace items that are electronics which is weird since my friend faced similar issue and he got a working laptop. And due to all this i had to re-schedule my interview and the company said we will be moving on with other candidates this time.Thank you AMAZON
Thinner Lack of Ports Still Cool Though 👍,17 people found this helpful,Sean,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TKKhgTdIL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZRvCGW0GL._SY300.jpg,4,2020-09-05T17:59:17,It s a Macbook Pro bro. What s there not to like. It s been 9yrs since my 2012 Macbook Pro purchase and I still use it. I just have to keep it plugged in because I can t find a good battery replacement for it. This M1 is much thinner. 😯 I would say half as thin as the 12 retina model.Battery life seems good but it was good on my last one. I can use it all day. Button press trackpad even the touchbar is good. I do not understand the complaints about the touchbar. I find it kinda cool and ok. Maybe my opinion will change after some use.The speed is what everyone raves about. I don t see it. It may be slightly faster but it s hard to tell just how much faster. When I open or load it doesn t seem super fast as everyone claims. I m sure it s faster but it s not like its drastically noticeable.I had one issue initially. I set up my fingerprint ID and all was fine until one day it didn t work and it asked me for my password. I could not remember my password and it took a whole day to figure out how to reset it. So far it s only happened once and I hope it doesn t happen again because using the fingerprint scanner I forgot my password already.😄The audio is good. Definitely not tinny or hollow its that good quality audio you expect. Good full sound. Volume is ok too could maybe be a little louder.I do not like that it has no ports. Just 2 usb C slots. 😐 You will have to buy an adapter. At least they kept the headphone jack. I also do not like clicking to drag n drop. I don t see any settings that I can change for this. I like being able to tap and 2 finger drag.I was expecting this to be really fast because that s what they were bragging about but for the money I maybe should have got the air with more GB. But the camera and sound is better on this one. The screen doesn t look as HD as the retina model seems a little flat but it s good. Overall you know the quality of Apple. I will most likely always have a Macbook Pro. 😉👍
Best Laptop in History,895 people found this helpful,JK Reviews,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed  looks  weight/size  display  and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color  the new keyboard  the Touch Bar  and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today  but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking  so after a TON of research  I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks  and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store  who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop  umm  do you have an appointment? Well  you re going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store . I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook  but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean  seriously  do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway  in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more)  the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it s not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing  blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water  and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes  256 ssd is standard - that s what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now  you don t really need to keep much on the laptop drive  you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I ve been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.
A Marked Improvement Over Intel MacBooks,711 people found this helpful,Ian,-,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such  Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed  battery life  and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks  plugins  software instruments  and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life  but it s not far off. This isn t a huge deal for me  as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available  but for someone who needs the portability  the difference is substantial.UPDATE 6/16/21: I have been using this laptop for over 6 months now on a daily basis. I have done everything from Word documents  email  web surfing  Logic Pro  Neural DSP guitar plugins  Adobe Lightroom  Adobe Illustrator  and many other tasks and I do not think that I have even heard the fan come on 1 time. It s pretty astounding. The M1 is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away. And while more and more apps become native to M1  I d expect performance to do nothing but improve.
MacBook Pro 13 with M1 chip  16 Gb memory,474 people found this helpful,AP,-,5,2020-01-11T11:59:17,I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great  the sound was superb  the screen bright  and it was blazing fast in all I did. I m an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

However  I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip  I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it s useless).Secondly  would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface  the MacBook turns off itself. I don t know what happened but I m pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also  I miss the MagSafe...

Everything I Expected-Except 1 Thing,221 people found this helpful,Kurt Luce,-,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I m going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let s be honest  that s what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it s handheld products years ago.Not that I care  it s good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn t include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that  I have no issues. It s fast  efficient  reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it ll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

Regret Going M1,38 people found this helpful,Steve,-,1,2020-04-23T14:12:17,The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can t get past that.Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.

There is no competing with the ease of Apple when talking about computing.,One person found this helpful,Joe D.,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,I love Apple when it comes to computing. Their software is efficient  error free and easy to use. Their computers perform efficiently and they virtually never freeze up. The only issue with my last Mac was that the mag safe power cord would consistently fray and the hard drive cable had to be replaced 3x over 8 years (should change every 2-3 yrs). This mac hasnt given me any problems in the first couple days. I did notice a lot of software and drivers dont seem to support the new Apple chips yet  but I have no doubt it will eventually happen.
Buy a USB port!,One person found this helpful,Jamilla Webb,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,I never make reviews but I have to make one for this. I ve had this computer since March and it s June now  and I have to say  I really  really  really love my computer. It s super fast and the speakers are loud and it s everything you could want. My only issue is that there is no USB port. When I m editing I find it very difficult to use the mousepad because I can t be precise with my work the way I do with a mouse. I just bought an adapter today  and I hope it makes my editing much more easier. But all I can say is that I spent a lot of money upgrading my 2011 MacBook Pro and I decided to just buy this computer with my stimulus check and it was the best decision I ve ever made.

M1 is not ready for prime-time  in my opinion.,15 people found this helpful,Fnorgby,-,3,2020-07-02T17:54:17,There are too many baffling oddball problems -- like it won t do portrait mode on a displayLink monitor. It has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine -- despite me turning off sleep and screen locking  when in clamshell closed mode  sometimes it won t wake up and has to be hard power-cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up. These issues are virtually nonexistent on Intel silicon of the same era/OS revision level. The problems with external monitors feel like they re reintroducing problems most vendors (INCLUDING APPLE) fixed over a decade ago.I m completely soured on M1  and have no interest in M1X. I may trade this in for a Mini. It s all but useless as portable computer because docking/undocking causes such nightmarish problems.M2 maybe  once it s been out for a year or two. Yes  I know that this is the risk of being an early-adopter. I m still going to call out its flaws even though I know I am the author of my own suffering here.Also  again not an apple problem but a me problem: I hate the touch bar and leave it completely disabled. I m clumsy and have big fingers.
Always Freezing or Crashing Programs,14 people found this helpful,Brittany,-,3,2020-09-25T15:59:17,I FINALLY  after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product (laptops  MacBooks  desktops) I decided I d get one as I needed a new laptop since my previous one was 10 years old. At first  I was just sad for having spent so much. I thought “this better convince me otherwise”. After having this for two months  I can say I hate it.Don t get me wrong  there s some decent features that add convenience  but I struggle to complete work in a timely manner as I have to constantly save or redo lost work. The MacBook can t consistently run (for example) Adobe InDesign  Adobe Illustrator  and one Google page. I know you re probably thinking “maybe her file size of the projects she s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness.” That is not the case.The work I am creating at this moment in time is basic web design  typographic studies of minor levels of file work  and an occasional image that needs photoshopped.All in all  this product is a bit expensive for my liking. It s got many decent aspects  such as a finger ID to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display. Cool. But not worth $1 300 (after tax) if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design.
Low power ports > Peripheral devices do not always get enough power to run,11 people found this helpful,Steve Sz,-,4,2020-09-06T17:39:17,For many people this will be a great and fast notebook. If you connect devices you need to know the ports are fast but can not supply very much power. If you have software on CD/DVD  be aware that your bus powered DVD drive probably will not work. Same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer SSD. To fix this you need a hub / dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub.

The computer arrived in two days  on time  a gift to our son who is heading to college.This space grey laptop is the perfect size and weight when on campus. It includes an audio jack and two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports.The package also includes a charger with a cord and a straightforward setup.I like the fantastic Apple design of this laptop with the space grey casing. I m glad overall that this laptop will last up to 20 hours on a charge  has a great screen  and is more than the required memory and speed as requested by the University.

If you're a windows user  read this.,3 people found this helpful,Dylan Swartzentuber,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,I am a long-time windows user. I ve had so many different windows laptops  each with their own faults. I ve always despised MacBooks because of what you hear from every person who s built a pc before:  Apple makes crappy products!!! No good to use!!!! . Ever since I got my iPad Pro a few years back  Apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become. With the release of the M1 macs  I was pretty interested in how well these will perform  and eventually caved and bought this MacBook Pro.I was wrong. I ve been wrong. This MacBook Pro has very good performance and has kicked ass through everything I throw at it. I like the Big Sur operating system  everything has been made super easy  and also connects to all of my other Apple devices. Being able to to text people from my MacBook is awesome. My only complaint is honestly  like everyone else  the Touch Bar. I wish I had the regular function keys like on the air. I got this one because of better battery life  and man. This laptop lasts me a WEEK. What???? My ol reliable acer laptop only lasted me 8 hours  and I thought that was good.Sorry windows fanboys. Sorry pc master race. For laptops (I will never replace my home windows desktop)  the MacBook is one of the best devices you can buy. It s great.

Nice!,4 people found this helpful,Anonymous Reviewer Dude,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,I got this for $1099  which it s $1299 if you buy it from Apple  which makes no sense! It was either this or the Macbook Air for $899 (which is $999 at Apple). I got this because I ve had many Macbook Airs and wanted something different. If I had to do it again  and wanted to save money I would have gotten the Air. The difference is this has a fan  a touch bar  a better gpu  and a brighter screen for $200 more. I was worried because some people don t like the touch bar but I think it s great! And besides  you can even set the touch bar up so it s just like the old function keys you re used to  but as touch keys.There really is no competition for a Macbook. I ve tried them all  the Dells  the Surfacebooks  etc  and they re never as good as an Apple Macbook.
powering of a macbook pro M1 unreliable only after 3 weeks of use.,3 people found this helpful,Amanda Hudak,-,2,2020-03-24T12:32:17,I was excited to get the new macbook pro M1 as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer. My first impression was strong. I started to play with all the features my old MacBook Pro is missing. I was excited about extending the screen to my iPad pro will be able to paint in photoshop (with Sidecar). This feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use (mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up). The next feature I was excited to try was installing iPad/iPhone app to MacBook Pro... Well  this works here and there  applications are crashing... again very underwhelming. Three weeks later my new MacBook Pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt. After I unplug it from power  the second time when plugin it wouldn t charge. I had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again. I ran self-diagnostic on startup and it would freeze. Luckily I was still in the Amazon window to return this now broken computer. I don t understand how Apple machines became so unreliable. Now I m hesitant to order another Apple computer as this is the very first new computer I ever purchased turns out to be a lemon.
Faster delivery than ordering from Apple,7 people found this helpful,Chad Mitchell,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,I was nervous buying a Macbook over Amazon  but the delivery was fast and required a signature. I have needed a new Macbook because I bought mine over five years ago. It is a nice computer and way faster than my old one. I was curious about the new M1 chip in the Macbook. It is a great purchase for the price since Macbooks last so long. Highly recommend.
Really Enjoying it!,5 people found this helpful,Alayahk,-,4,2020-06-18T12:59:17,I love my MacBook Pro! I had the 13 inch macbook air 2017 and I hated that thing  used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away. I always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better. Finally was able to buy one and so far so good. I really hope and pray this one doesn t start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or 2. Bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers. I mainly use it for work  school/zoom calls and a little bit of streaming. Not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about. Battery life was amazing for the first 2 weeks but I can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it s from how much i ve been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days (most likely 2) battery life hangs in there.
Flimsy screen,3 people found this helpful,Patrick Walsh,-,1,2020-04-15T17:59:17,I left my brand new M1 Macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a Picasso painting. Both Amazon and Apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer s defect  even though I bought it only two months ago. So I m out $700 to repair a two month old computer. I would heavily advise against buying one of these  because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer s defect  then 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen. This means that they re essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.
Of course I love it,One person found this helpful,juju,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,this is my 3rd Macbook pro. and each time it gets better. Much thinner than my previous one  and very light weight. the only thing I don t like is that it only has the USB c  which doesn t allow charging of other devices. I had to go and get the adaptor for an additional $20. Also they don t include the extension cord anymore  which I don t mind  since I already have 2 that came with the other ones.

She uses Zoom an Google Classroom and these programs work flawlessly on a MBP M1. We do not plan on doing heavy tasks on this laptop  just the basic browsing  social media  video calls and online school stuff. It s pretty fast  but I find that our 2014 16  MBP retina to be the same. The battery lasts FOR DAAAAAYYYYSSSSS. A full charge lasted 4 days w/ 3 hours of daily use. Quite impressed! I know how sturdy MBP s are with our 2013 and 2014 MBP s still alive and working well  so I know I ll get our money s worth with this laptop.TLDR: Lightweight  battery for days  super fast  apps and programs work seamlessly for students.
It’s the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip  what else is there to say?,2 people found this helpful,AdderallTaco,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,Coming from one of the worst MacBook Pro generations (2017) this was a breath of fresh air. Very snappy  quiet  cool  long battery life  FANTASTIC KEYBOARD (Those butterfly switches were a mess) Oh and the touchbar  I love that thing  didn t think I d use it a lot but here I am using it a lot😂 It s an amazing laptop  the only laptop I d ever recommend anyone get (besides the MacBook Air)
Powerbook Disappointing,One person found this helpful,artie,-,3,2020-09-05T17:59:17,Lacks DVD drive: no movies whilst on the road  also  all music has to be purchased. My wealth of great music CD s not accessible. Arrived fully charged. Looks nice  just not versatile enough. Steve Jobs needed at Apple. Alas.
So happy with this MacBook!,-,TroppoBella on Etsy,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,The screen on my 2014 does  and I didn t;t want to send the money on a new one  but the exterior screen started giving me problems  too  and I threw in the towel. Boy  am I thrilled that I did! This little MacBook is perfect! It s even more user friendly  has amazing colors  and functions with all modern apps. I m absolutely in love with it!
Amazing Computer!!!!,2 people found this helpful,SP,-,5,2020-03-19T13:59:17,This laptop is the most luxury and professional computer I have ever owned. 10/10 would recommend to anyone in school  business  or even for personal use. The typing experience on this laptop is like nothing you have ever felt. I am very pleased!
Almost Perfect..,One person found this helpful,Kanan Adilzada,-,5,2020-07-12T13:59:17,Only downgrades:1. Screen bezzels are thick2. Keyboard is not as good as some of the windows laptops such as HP Spectre3. This Mac has incredible performance but so pitty some legendary games are only available for windows.The rest features (despite the display color gamut) are amazing and better than any other ultrabooks.So  4.5/5.
Love the screen color,-,Janet,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1bqfJ7l6mS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1gSnaK1WWS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,I really like my purchase of the MacBook Pro. It is super fast. The colors on the screen are bright & clear. I love the the 13 inch screen. It s the perfect size for me. Since it didn t have any usb plug ins I bought me a hub for it that has usb  hdmi  slot for memory card & it has 3.0. Love this Mac. Would recommend it.
Best Mac to Date,One person found this helpful,Lance Nguyen,-,4,2020-02-18T17:23:17,Upgraded from a 2015 Macbook Pro that has lasted me well more than 5 years in school. I expected the keyboard to be like the earlier gen macbooks; however  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were way more raised and offered a much better tactile feedback. In addition  the battery life will easily last a day of school. The only thing I don t like about this laptop is how the M1 Chip doesn t support VM and a few other apps; but that can be changed in the future.

Major The screen ghosting and dead pixel issues after about 3 1/2 weeks,-,James I Reed,-,2,2020-04-15T17:59:17,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  On the right hand side you can see a black line of dead pixels that quickly became much worse. And although it was on every window you can really see it on the graph where the image burned into the 3 week old screen that I barely used and bought specifically because it was considered the best option for trading view the program in the video. You can see. Facebook logo burnt in on the right but the whole screen was ghosting everything bad. It s just hard to see most of it. I have no idea what caused this. As it s not a 20 year old crt display with an nes left on for years. It s a brand new Liquid Retina I m sure I m not the only one to experience this but do keep in mind I was lucky and able to return because this happened one day before my 30 day window closed. My experience with apple has always been with second market items aside from my phone they are not very helpful unless you pay a very high service fee. I m sure I could have had this repaired for free but at the price and the fact that it was my very first Mac I sent it back and have no intention on owning another one. Best thing I could suggest is if you must own a Mack buy apple care they will replace it twice brand new. U may need that done. The build quality outside of the electronics is unmatched. Absolute perfection in every seam. I wish it would have worked I bolutely loved this machine until the day it broke down. Now I won t ever feel comfortable owning a new one again. I did purchase the m1 iPad instead and love it. Well my 2tb model. The 128 is not enough storage 2tb I m sure will be plenty. I think apple is a great product as long u never have any issues. If you do be ready to spend like you did the day you made your purchase.
False advertising,5 people found this helpful,Shayna,-,1,2020-03-19T13:59:17,If I could give this 0 stars I would. I bought this computer “new” however after using it for 2 weeks I realized that I have pictures on it of another family. This was clearly a used computer and falsely advertised as “new”. I paid way to much for a used computer. Do not purchase.
Worst computer I have ever purchased.,One person found this helpful,Brian Haney,-,1,2020-07-12T13:59:17,I am extremely disappointed with this machine. I bought this specifically because it had a GPU  which I thought would be beneficial for programming with data. However  the new Apple Chip is completely unworkable. None of the modern software packages for data science are compatible with the chip  rendering the machine worthless and void for its intended purpose. I will never purchase another Apple machine.
Amazing laptop but felt a little slow for some reason,One person found this helpful,Puru,-,4,2020-07-23T17:59:17,I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop (a behemoth of a gaming laptop) broke suddenly broke down. It was great  except for the fact that it felt a little slow. Maybe it is because I had downgraded from a 144hz screen to a 60hz screen  or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster  it just didn t feel that good. However  other than that  it is an amazing laptop. Very portable  and doesn t really heat up that much. Also  it charges super fast  therefore I could charge it for 30 min to 1 hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it. Overall  it is an amazing product  however  it wasn t the one for me.
Too fragile,3 people found this helpful,Janesk,-,1,2020-03-19T13:59:17,I purchased this laptop and it dropped  but not a hard drop and the screen broke. We had to replace it and did so with an original screen. It got hit again  not hard (I swear!) and it broke again. I ve never had a laptop that s as fragile as this one.
Keep the intel!,4 people found this helpful,Rs,-,1,2020-08-24T11:59:17,Battery life and new keyboard if nice but this mac freezes a lot. When you open more than 10 tabs  when open finder  when connecting to external monitor this m1 freezes I need to constantly force quit the applications. This Macbook  pro  only  supports  one external monitor. Not a reliable laptop.

I love this MacBook Pro! I have it hooked up to a 30 inch Apple display and it is wicked cool. And I have the Apple Magic Mouse 2 and Apple keyboard.
Pesimo. Menos de 5 meses y ya se malogró,One person found this helpful,Luis N.,-,1,2020-08-22T17:59:17,La compré en abril  pero la comencé a usar recién en mayo 2021. A comienzos de setiembre comenzó a fallar el touchbar y ese mismo día se apagó y no volvió a encender.El servicio técnico dice que es un fallo eléctrico y tendrán que cambiar varias partes  incluyendo la batería  el touch bar  el teclado  etc. Es decir  una computadora de casi 1500 requiere un mantenimiento bastante grande luego de solo 4 meses de uso.Me parece bastante mal. Obviamente  desde donde estoy es imposible comunicarse directamente con la empresa. La página web dice que siempre está ocupada y el servicio técnico hace que los clientes firmen un documento que  básicamente  sirve para que no haya opción a reclamar. Es más  si no dejo que la reparen  estoy obligado a pagarles por el diagnóstico.No puedo recomendar un producto tan caro que se estropee tan rápido.
MUST BE THE BEST MACBOOK YET!,2 people found this helpful,Lee,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,This M1 Mac is a true gem! 💎 Apple really looked out for us budding students both of life and in the classroom  on a tight budget! You can really grow with this mean machine! This Mac blows me away  especially my first and last Mac being the Mac Pro 2011. Btw the MODEL NUMBER is A2338! Got this during tax free week too .. Received in 1 day with Amazon Prime! 😮‍💨🙏🏾👍🏾 p.s. I LOVE the Touch Bar! So futuristic and cool to navigate from like a space ship 🚀 I can totally see apple doing an option for all touch screen keyboard………….
