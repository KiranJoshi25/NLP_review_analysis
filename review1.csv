Easy to use and quick adjustments,15 people found this helpful,Jonathan F.,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91OiLuaIrCL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bUm9d7w9L._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,I have another massage gun that is very similar  but isn t as user friendly when it comes to turning on and off as it requires users to press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on/off. I like how this one is easy to operate and has a simple on and off button  and +/- buttons to increase or decrease speeds. I m not a huge fan of the main power switch at the bottom of the unit  as it seems unnecessary when there s already a power button at the top of the unit by the screen. Although the battery indicator LED ring at the bottom of the handle remains on at all times until the main power switch is turned off. The built in timer is also handy for measuring how long massages have gone on for.Over all it comes with several nice heads for different massage functions and parts of your body. They all seem good quality  and it was also nice to see replacement rubber gaskets for when the originals get worn out after being used so much. The storage case also seems good quality with a faux carbon fiber pattern.

I ve tried different massage guns in the past and truly was not impressed. I figured I needed to get a more professional massage gun and boy did I find it!This is a PREMIUM product. Here s what I love about this DarkIron massage gun in the order of experiencing it.1. the packaging - I felt like I was unboxing an Apple product. It comes in a sick carbon fiber carrying case with the gun  the FIFTEEN attachments and the charger.2. build quality - the felt finish on the massage gun feels top notch. definitely won t irritate your hands when holding for extended periods of time. there s nothing cheap about it  premium quality parts.3. the lights! - it s so cool how the screen and the lights are so modern. I know you don t buy a massage gun for the lights but I love that the manufacturer put the effort to make the product look cool - they didn t have to but they did!4. massage options - with the multiple attachments and varying speeds and intensity  you re sure to find relief from any pains. Long lasting relief that I never got from a physical therapist.5. superior battery life - no need to worry about running out of charge during a massage. Even on the highest setting you really don t need to worry as this thing holds a charge through it all.6. pain relief - I mostly use it on my lower back to treat my sciatica and this is the ONLY thing that relieves that pain. I used to follow YouTube videos with stretches and exercises that probably worked great for others but not for me. my chiropractor used this gun on me and I had long lasting relief so I bought the same one he uses. so glad I ve finally found it here on amazon and can use it at my leisure!So that s my list! one of the best purchases I ve made on amazon and I m sure you ll say the same!
The Ultimate Gift for Athletes & Fantastic on Achy Joints!,8 people found this helpful,Joe H.,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812l+3ox2rL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PmYSPsUmL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SgqLD8NCL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bwTVMBbjL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-27T11:59:17,My husband is a marathon running and logs a lot of miles each week. He had purchased a massage gun last year that came with only one attachment and cost $300. He likes that massager a lot but wanted a second one to keep at work  so he could use it after he runs at lunch time. I started looking at different ones and decided on this one because it had different attachments  which I thought might be handy. I figured it wouldn t be as good as his expensive one  but it would get the job done.My husband took this massager to work with him the day after it arrived  and he actually called me that afternoon  to tell me how much he LOVED it! He said the attachments are awesome! He often has a sore IT band and tight hamstrings after running long distances and there is an attachment that fits right into those muscle so he can really give it a deep tissue massage. He brought this one home with him and keeps it at our house and the expensive one at work now  because he loves this one so much and wants to be able to use it after his long runs on the weekends.I even had him use the massager on my neck and shoulders one night last week. I broke my neck in a car accident 20 years back and have had neck issues ever since. Sometimes it aches so bad  and the muscles in my neck get so tight  I end up with a terrible migraine. The night he used the massager on my neck  I slept fantastic and I woke up feeling very relaxed. I told him that we might need to make that a new ritual every night before bed.If you are an athlete  or have one in your life  this is the perfect gift for them! If you have aches and pains yourself  regardless of how old they are  I can almost guarantee this massager will bring you relief. Don t waste your money on the more expensive ones - this one is 10 times better and a third of the cost!
Great gift for dad with Father's Day coming up!,7 people found this helpful,GT,-,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,First and foremost  the packaging on the massage gun was really nice. I really like that the box was even sealed with a plastic layer. When you open the box  you will be pleasantly surprised to see that this item even comes with a nice carrying case with a carbon fiber type of shell. Also  my favorite thing about the massage gun is the 15 attachments that it comes with!!! Each attachment is perfectly shaped to contour different parts of your body that you are massaging.Anyway  I exercise a lot (lift weights) and this massage gun has helped me recover faster than before I started using the massage gun. I especially like to use the massage gun after  leg day . To anyone that does intense leg days like I do (squats  lunges  deadlifts  hip thrusts  etc)  you know how long it takes to recover before you can start walking normal again. For me  by the time I recover (a week) it is leg day again. But ever since I started using the massage gun  my recovery has gone from a week to just a few days.I highly recommend this massage gun to anyone as it is very relaxing and of great value for the quality you are getting. Great gift for dad with Father s Day coming up  or just a great gift to yourself or anyone in general!

It arrived super fast  brand new and wrapped. I love the beautiful case it comes with the keep all of the parts together. There is even a separate case for all of the attachments and there are so many that you will have an attachment for any area you are wanting to massage. I charged it the recommended time and boy does it work like a charm. You have the ability to set the intensity and use it for as long as you need without having to recharge it because one charge lasts forever!! It isn t too heavy  I was a bit worried about that because I have small hands but it fits nicely in my hand and it is very easy to use. I highly recommend it! It made a wonderful early fathers day gift :)
Good quality and great buy!!,6 people found this helpful,Abhilash Reddy,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716hCOoPRCL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mA8ZLDeLL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-09-05T17:59:17,I was looking for a cordless massage gun and after a good amount of research  I was convinced to purchase this option. It was quickly delivered and I couldn t wait to open it :). I was amazed at how the massage gun arrived  the packaging was so perfect  everything inside looked so well organized. And when I tried it  it was easy to use  I tried almost all the heads it came with  and I was also pretty happy with different adjustment levels. It s been about a week I received it and I have been using the massage gun ever since then  especially post-workout when it gets really difficult for me to end my day with all the sore muscles  this massage gun gives me great relief and it quickly puts me to sleep. I have been using it a lot  I would say it s equal to relief from a massage chair. Though it makes some noise at times  the gun works really effectively  the timer helps monitor the durations  and has good battery life. I am greatly satisfied with its performance and I m glad I bought this massage gun. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent all-purpose massager.
Great value for working out the knots!,2 people found this helpful,mchoodies,-,5,2020-07-16T12:59:17,I ve seen these for a few years now and kept thinking my husband would like one; but never pulled the trigger because those that I ve come across were hundreds of dollars. Now I ve been seeing ones that are much more affordable and with sleek or techy design.My husband and I have decided recently to get into the art of jiu jitsu- so it was the perfect excuse to purchase a massage gun. We figured we d be very sore considering we re now in our upper 30s just starting a sport. Given the aesthetics  we often for this model.At first it was intimidating and uncomfortable. It hurt in some areas and tickled in other spots- we giggled and joked on our first tries. It wasn t relaxing initially due to us tensing up. However  we kept trying it with different heads and on different muscles a few different times. Once you get the hang of it  the benefits reveal themselves. I have found that it s much more comfortable and effective when I use it on myself. By doing it myself  I know exactly where  when  and at what pressure it will start with- instead of tensing my body when my husband says he ll help me.The other night; for example  I had a right neck on one side from sleeping on a different pillow. When my husband swapped out the head to the neck attachment- it looked painful with the forked head. I was used to the soft cushioned ball head. I pulled away just as he started and the vibration felt overly powerful. But when I took it from him  I could reach over my shoulder at just the right angle so it was a gentle contact and I could work up to putting more pressure in my problem areas.Overall it s been great  just took a little bit of a learning curve to figure out how best to utilize it on each of us. The display is crisp  bright and easy to understand the settings. The battery life has been great- despite the instructions saying to charge it before use  we used it right out of the box. It had a full charge and here it is a month later and it hasn t needed charged yet.
Worth the money!,3 people found this helpful,Kindle Customer,-,5,2020-01-11T11:59:17,So I got this for my mom whose husband had back surgery some years ago and suffers from stiffness and pain. She is a tiny woman so massaging his back and shoulders were a bit of a chore. This little machine does all the work for her. The gun itself is lightweight  the screen is easy to read and  according to the reviews I ve read  the battery life seems to be very good. (We haven t used up all the battery power of the first charge yet so I cant speak to the actual length.) The carrying case is great because my parents travel a bit and it will be easy to them to throw it behind the seat to bring in case of emergency. Overall  this was a great buy and would make a really good gift. Ours had a coupon code so we took advantage of that.Bottom line: Yes this massager costs more than some cheaper options  but it s nowhere near as expensive as many others and I am very pleased with the upgrade. It works well for me thus far  with powerful results and the battery life seems to be quite sufficient for my needs.
5 stars for several reasons,One person found this helpful,Tom P,-,5,2020-09-25T15:59:17,I ve tried other massage guns  one at twice the price and found this to be on equal level for quality  massage head options and effectiveness.I waited for two months before posting this review as I wanted to have enough usage to accurately leave a review. And after two months I can confidently say I do not regret my purchase.While the foam head is all bit useless for me (as are a few others) the number of heads included is surprising. The heads alone make this purchase worth it.The battery is long lasting but does drain fairly quickly when the gun is running at full speed. Still  charging is simple and quick enough to make this a non issue.It is not as powerful as another I used ($300) nor is the gun ergonomically as comfortable as other designs but for the cost  these  again  are non issues.All in all  I have no reservations leaving a 5 star review and already have suggested this product to friends and family
Everything I wanted and more at a good price!,2 people found this helpful,GS,-,4,2020-05-15T12:59:17,I ve been wanting a massage gun for a while but they always seemed too expensive and was cautious about getting a knock off due to stories I ve heard. Boy what a pleasant surprise at this Darkiron gun. I ve tried my friends more expensive gun and this one does the trick just as well. It even has more attachments. 15! Don t like switching between them all but I ve figured out a few that are multipurpose that work for my sore muscles. I pulled my neck out and was in quite a bit of pain which was why I finally pulled the trigger (no pun intended) and bought this gun. It sure helped. I recommend this if your looking for a massage gun without the expense. Not sure about the battery life yet. Will keep you posted.

Great value for an excellent product,-,tomlinla,-,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,I had been contemplating purchasing a percussion massager for several months  but was not interested in paying hundreds of dollars. I was worried that I would be disappointed with the quality if I didn t spend a lot of money. Nothing could be further from the truth with this massager. The battery life is excellent. It has a ton of power and it truly does reduce soreness after a workout. I m sooooo happy I decided to buy this product. I have recommended it to several of my friends.

The strength/pressure options  the different heads  the timer and price all make for a great device. The battery life so far has been exceptional as well. Very easy to use  easy to switch massage heads  and the manual lists the different areas of the body that the massager is best for - although you can play around and figure that out for yourself as everyone is different. I m very happy with this purchase.
Game Changer for Exercise Rehab,-,Jackson,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1EVZeacfIS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1QF443sDaS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,After recently using my friends  massage guns  I was convinced they were worth it. While they had massage guns that cost a couple hundred dollar  I didn t want to spend that much  but found this.It s very high quality for much less the price. The carrying case and massage gun are made surprising well (see pictures of LED screen).If you re not convinced about massage guns you should definitely go to an REI or similar store to try one out  because they work incredibly well. They seem (for me at least) to be better at working out muscles than the rollers I ve had in the past. So far I ve used mainly after running and weight lifting  but I m stoked to bring it on my skiing trips this winter.
Our go-to for muscle soreness,-,Robin R,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1FXJ2PANyS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,We ve had a couple of these massage guns in our house over the last few years  and I d say this one is the best one we ve owned. The 4 settings are a good range of intensities and the different attachments literally have something for every part of the body. My husband has bad back pain so I use this on his back often - it s relatively light weight and v easy to use. It was on mega sale when I bought it and I feel like it was a steal! Would definitely recommend.
This thing is great!,-,brian s,-,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I bought this mainly because I am dealing with sciatica pain. We previously had a weirdly-designed massage wand that basically causes carpal tunnel in the unfortunate person doing the massaging. Just no thought regarding ergonomics at all. This pistol-grip design is much easier to use  and the quality on this model seems first-rate. It s plug-and-play; no assembly or complex instructions -- it just works  and with a lot of control over accuracy  speed  etc.
SLEEK POWERFUL & ATTACHMENTS,-,Juan pliego,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EmxZ-7BoL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916FNftAjnL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BwTDYsM4L._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iXgqUKcQL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-02-10T17:59:17,The box came was sleek in a a factory wrapped box i loved that it was black especially the carrying case it makes everyone just look better. I first noticed that the gun was wrapped which was nice and then the attachments had its own carrying case.My previous gun only game with 3 attachments BUT. This one came with 15. I was impressed!I charged it first before using. I love the Color LED screen definitely an upgrade from my previous gun!Attachments are amazing! I was able to use it after a gym work out and couldn t be any happierDefinitely an A+ product
Helps relieve pain & stiffness from sitting all day,-,Barbara Cooper,-,5,2020-09-06T17:39:17,Helps me relax! Unfortunately  I sit at a computer all day for work. By the time I get home  my back  shoulder and legs are very tired and sore. I purchased this massage gun because I thought it would help me relax and feel less pain.After a lot of researching  I decided on this particular because of the great reviews. Now  I get to leave my own great review for this product!Instructions for operation and use are clear and concise. Nicely organized and easy to store after use.So far  we ve only used this massage gun about four times but Now I look forward to coming home and using it on my back and shoulders.
Solid and effective massager,One person found this helpful,Amazon Customer,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ZHlovct2L._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-27T11:59:17,Surprisingly robust piece of equipment. The motion is very strong even when pressing down hard on tissue. Many different massage heads to choose from for different body parts. The charge is impressive  too. It s still green after two full sessions. Ready to understand and operate. Really impressed with the time that tells you the length of your massage. Nice caring case for travel.
Gets deep muscles like a dream!,-,Allene Windom,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+B4w1k2xS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C12a+6nlxqS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1TMEFfuoIS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-03-19T13:59:17,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Absolutely the best item I have ever purchased on-line! I got this for myself as a birthday present and I am in LOVE with this massager! It helps with sore  tight muscles  muscle cramps  and relaxes muscles like a dream! I ve had it 3 weeks now and it is still working on the original charge  so amazing battery life! It s easy to use on myself and it s a nightly routine for me now. I sleep SO much better after using it! I highly recommend this for everyone! It even has a really great case and various heads to use on it for different areas of the body. BEST. PURCHASE. EVER.
Excellent Gun Massage,-,Midori,-,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,It looks like a shop tool but it does the work on muscle ache. Great quality  happy with discounted price  fast delivery  and a variety of attachments. A friend in Arizona recommended this product for its quality. I suffer from tendinitis on both forearms from years of weight training and it helped breakdown knots and muscle tears. I used it on my husbands back and neck area and he says it helps reduce stress and pain. Never felt better.

Never tried it and was very skeptical. After using the massage gun my muscles felt really relaxed? Great instructions for use of each tool. Not to heavy to handle. Battery life good so far. Would buy another one.
great product,-,Nicki,-,5,2020-01-11T11:59:17,Muscle Massager Gun Deep Tissue Percussion Muscle Massager for Athletes with 15 Heads & 4 SpeedsThis is my first Massage Gun experience with a massage gun. LOVE IT!!Easy to use  light weight  quiet  multiple head options.The product came exactly as described. Seems to be a high quality product. The heads all switch out easily. I have had it for a few weeks now and use it several times a week - sometimes a few times a day. My job requires me to sit for long hours so I can get really tense neck  back hip and legs from not being able to walk around a lot. This little machine is an absolute life saver. My only regret is that I waited so long to make the purchase!
Purchase it! You won’t be disappointed!,-,Kayla,-,5,2020-02-10T17:59:17,I wanted to try this because my boyfriend gets really bad back pain after lifting heavy objects for his job. Went through all the many attachments and he loved them all but his favorite was the flat circle attachment. He said his back felt more relaxed and the tightness in his lower back was gone! I m impressed with the packaging it came in and also the travel and storage case it comes with. It s very sleek and professional looking and extremely easy to use. I m super happy and would recommend this to anyone who has been searching for a good massage gun!
A bit bulky but powerful with a variety of attachments,-,Ehsan N,-,4,2020-09-29T17:59:17,The power is great. At first  the bulky grip  needs to get use to but when you figure it out it s not so difficult. It comes with a variety of heads but I only use 2-3 of the attachments. I have to recharge every 3-4 usage. That s y I gave it 4 stars. But It works great on soar and cramped muscles.
So simple and portable,-,Tyler Robbins,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,I had previously cheaped out and bought attachments for my jigsaw. I broke down and got this and am very pleased with it.I didn t realize how much I appreciated just having it on the couch with me. It says the battery life is 3-4 hours which seems like an eternity for something you might use 5 minutes at a time.I also have to say  the carrying case and the quality feel of this product surprised me. It s not like unboxing an Apple product  but clearly they have put time into the design even of the packaging.
Does Not Disappoint!,-,Cheska Lindaya-Tamase,-,4,2020-04-17T17:59:17,I got this for my husband as an early Father s Day present -- he has a bad back and constantly needs a massage  mostly from me. Well  when I say this has relieved me of the job  I am not kidding! It s very powerful  even on the lowest setting! It also comes with 15 attachments that target different areas  is rechargable and holds a long charge  plus it s fairly quiet apart from the typical vibration sound. I ve always wanted to get one of these  but constantly hesitate because of how expensive it is in most places! Not this one though! Very affordable and practical. 10/10 would recommend!
Nice little tool  very effective and useful,-,Krish Maddirala,-,5,2020-03-19T13:59:17,This product is very useful and very effective in pain relief. I and my wife liked this massager and the various attachments that come with it. The speeds are very good and the battery life or charge holds good for up to 10 times. This product is highly recommended and it is very easy to use.
Works well on sore muscles,-,ftbooklover,-,5,2020-01-23T12:59:17,Product works as described. Used it after a workout. Typically I m sore for 2 or 3 days after a high intensity workout. Used on my quads and hamstrings. Was able to be fully mobile and maintained flexibility post workout. Will use again pre workout to warm up muscles next time.
Impressive and very sturdy !!!,-,Luiz Eduardo Moraes,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1xhyo6o-sS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1MkiOmZzHS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1XwKuEo-GS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,I am really impressed how sturdy and well made it is  I wasn t expecting that quality for a massage gun with this price. It looks have been made for professional use and comes with 2 hard cases to store the product  one for the attachments and other bigger one for the gun and cables. 100% approved !!!
Zero customer service,-,Very Disappointed,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iZ45LpqqL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rgoEUzdTL._SY300.jpg,1,2020-01-18T17:53:17,I gave this messager as a gift and it was periodically for a total of one hour and it started making a rattling noise then the head and a screw fell out. To claim a warranty since they offer a “ life time replacement” the person who I gave it to has registered the product with Dark Iron and followed all the necessary procedures yet no response after 4 attempts.I am just trying to get this broken item replaced yet the companies boasting of great customer support and guaranteed replacement is phony.I will update this review if Dark Iron does decide to honor what they advertise for their warranty.At this point I would not recommend anyone purchase their product.
Truly amazing! My wife loves it,-,Josiah,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,My wife loves massages  but I get tired quickly when giving them. My thumbs get sore. But this thing does a better job than I ever could  while making things a lot easier on me too. Wonderful variety of attachments (the one for the foot sole is incredible). Have only had this for about a week  and will update the review if anything changes. But so far everything has been great. Can t believe the battery lasts as long as it does  too.
Relief  quick and easy,-,Minneapplemuffin,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,This offers relief from muscle soreness  body pain and ease of use if by yourself. It s a bonus if you have someone that can assist you with the massage but not necessary.You control the intensity and duration needed to find relief.We are super happy with our purchase and will be purchasing for gifts in the future.
Good massage percussion gun that comes with many accessories.,-,Max,-,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,I have tried several percussion massage guns including Theragun and Hypervolt. I do own a hypervolt and use it almost daily. I was looking to get another percussion gun for the convenience of having one in each hand when performing massages on my wife or myself. I saw the Darkiron massage gun and like the price point along with all 15 attachments it came with including a case. In comparison to a Hypervolt it is quiet and has the same effectiveness. The only significant difference is the percussion power. The Darkiron s highest 3rd level feels about like a 1-2 in comparison to Hypervolt. But for the price and the accessories I m pleased with the Darkiron. It still does the job and doesn t break the bank.
Great massage gun for the price!,-,Roberto,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CTej2QC8L._SY300.jpg,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,This massage gun is great for the price!I have a friend who is a trainer and he has one of those $300-400 massage guns  so I was initially pretty skeptical when I got this one as I have used his in the past.But to my surprise  this one was just as quiet. Not only that  I have heard of some massage guns not being able to withstand some force when trying to get the deeper spots  but this one did not budge. Last  the display is extremely helpful  it tells you the battery life  the speed level  and it also has a timer which is a great feature I did not know I needed. Overall I have had this for a few days and I am very pleased. If anything come sup i will be sure to update this review .
First my massage gun came 2 days early. Second it came charged for about 15 minutes,-,Shirley,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,Loved that it came charged for about 15 minutes  so you can try it out to see how you like it. My massage gun came 2 days early  which I think was a bonus. I tried it out seems like it is going to help my tense muscles. It really feels good on my tense muscles in my thigh. After it charges I m going to use it again tomorrow.
A powerful massage gun that has all the necessary attachments you will ever need!,-,Stephen W.,-,5,2020-07-12T13:59:17,I ve been looking for a massager that can really dig deep  as my pain is sometimes unbearable  especially my sciatica. My upper legs are always sore  and this massage gun is so powerful; it s enough that I haven t even needed to use the highest setting yet. So far I m using either level 1 or 2 depending on the areas I m using for. I find that the deep tissue attachment is the hardest one to detach from the gun as it s slick and short and doesn t have enough room to grab. I usually just use the rubbery pad that opens tight jar or bottle caps. Otherwise  this well-packaged massage gun is a perfect companion for me.
Very impressed with massager,-,Tony,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1lqvKYM9fS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1y4zebtV+S._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1So-j45-3S._SY300.jpg,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,Very impressed with this massager. My chiropractor has a similar one that really helps so it was about time I invested in one for my own health. Love the travel case that it comes with. Instructions were clear and simple. Still getting used to the different attachments but very impressed with power of it as well as battery life.
Pain relief  easy to use,-,Krishna,-,5,2020-01-18T17:53:17,I ordered this massager as I do a lot of cycling and occasionally have pain i the thigh and calf muscles. This is a well built massager which relieves pain when used as directed. It comes with a good battery life and multiple tools/accessories which can be used with different muscles areas. The packaging is simply great and the machine come with a Matt finish handle which is great. The display is good and comes with multiple speeds to operate. The battery power is displayed as well which will tell us the amount of battery left. The instructions provided are easy to use and follow. I definitely recommend this product.
Your body will appreciate It.,-,Dawn,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,This hand massaging machine is the greatest for your body. I charge it yesterday and after it was fully charged I used for 30 minutes. The battery life is still going strong today. There are many adjustable parts for each different section of your body. It s very easy to use because you can raise or lower the resistance level. I was able to get some of the knots out of my legs. It s very soothing for a pain reliever because you will feel so relaxed afterwards. Don t hesitate  click that button and now.
Amazing!,-,Concepcion Campos,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1kW6HoeD6S._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1cZgTOLMYS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This massage gun is very easy to use and feels very comforting on sore muscles. My partner has a very labor intensive job and he has received much relief with this massage gun. The various attachments all provide different intensities and vibrations  it s difficult to choose my favorite one. My only regret is not buying this sooner. I am thinking about buying a couple more to give as gifts to friends who would definitely enjoy the pleasure that comes from this massage gun.
Great!,-,Jay,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+EIGldcIL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,This is a solid massager! It is not cheaply made  for this price it is a steal. The battery life is really good considering I ve used it for intervals of 15 min about twice a day for about 5 days and the it says full battery still. When the device arrived it was fully charged. I have sciatica and loosening up the muscles helps the nerve feel better and with this massager it has been doing exactly that. I counted about 13 to 14 different attachments! And the case it awesome. Get it!
Best Massager Gun,-,Soozoxo,-,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,This massager gun has many attachments  is lightweight and is easy to use. It has tremendous power and can adjust intensity very easily. It comes in a solid durable case  and the attachments have their own zippered case inside the massager gun case. I did a lot of research on various massager guns and found this one to have excellent reviews and it more than exceeded my expectations.

Great massage gun for daily use.,-,Dannyjc,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,This massage gun is awesome. My second gun  and favorite. This massage gun is quiet and powerful. I can watch TV will using it  something not possible with my old gun. It comes with a ton of attachments to help target different muscles and different areas. Very sleek and simple controls. This massage gun is a great value at a fraction of the price of other name brand models.
Good quality for the price .,-,Jordan,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,Well first of all I was a little nervous before I purchased this product. I was sure it will perform as good as the super expensive ones  but let me tell you it does the trick! I have chronic muscle tension around my neck and pelvic area  and the pain is absolutely consistent. I always do yoga and somehow manage to make it worse. I started using this massage gun in a area where it hurts and it loosens up the nods and I feel so much better. I do like that I can use different heads for different parts of my body. The quality of the massage gun is way better than I expected. It doesn t feel like a cheap plastic. Very sturdy. I would recommend this massage gun to anyone who has chronic pain issues like me.
Good balance and comes with a nice box,-,Savvy,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CzhtK+x4L._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91KB40Pd+DL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91aFyQWI+6L._SY300.jpg,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I was impressed just after opening the box. It came in a nice case. Built quality looks good. The led dial behind shows all the information you need to know what mode it is on. The grip and weight are well balanced. Very easy to use and battery life is holding good so far. Haven t checked all the end adapter yet but there are many different kinds for different application. I bought it for my back pain. I believe it will work whenever next back pain hits. Overall I am impressed.
Worth it!,-,H.

So glad I went ahead and ordered this - is totally worth it. It feels so good and will help relieve my tension and stress. I can t do the more intense levels but I would consider it to have a good intensity range. Easy on/off switch. You can just pull out and switch heads. Display lights up to show 1-4 intensity bars and 1-4 battery bars.
Great Massage Gun..*buy it*,-,Ashley Melton,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,I bought this as a Father s Day present for my husband and he has been in love since the first use.He has a very physical demanding job and always wants to use it after his showers. His favorite attachment is the round ball  it is probably the most universal  where most of the other attachments are for more targeted areas. The battery life is great and long lasting.
Best Massage Gun for the Price!,-,Ryan N.,-,5,2020-07-23T17:59:17,Man  when I opened the box and saw the cool case  I felt like I was opening something from APPLE. Very sleek packaging. Then I opened the soft case that comes with it and it kept getting better  the thing feels VERY well made  solid and weighty. Once I turned the power on and hit the button  I was amazed at just how cool the LCD screen looked! Now to the actual reason I purchased it  the ability to work out tight and sore muscles  with the FIFTEEN attachments that come with it  I was able to try each one and throughly enjoyed that! I dont know how well the battery life holds up yet but judging by how well its made  I feel like it ll be just fine. VERY happy I bought this one!!
Feels so good,-,Dirk,-,5,2020-04-23T14:12:17,I am older and have some sore muscles. After researching and reading many reviews for massaging units like this one  I made my order. BOY; I was surprised on how well this massaging gun works. I have used many massaging machines over my years but this one hit all the spots.This massaging gun is very quiet and using the attachment of choice can make your muscles relax quickly. I have used it on other family members and ooohhhh and aaawww is the reactions you get.This is a great massaging gun for the price point and your body will thank you too.
Great value for 15 massage heads,-,adriana lorio,-,5,2020-07-02T17:54:17,This is the perfect Father s day gift! The packaging on the massage gun was really nice. I really like that the box was even sealed with a plastic layer. When you open the box  you will be pleasantly surprised to see that this item even comes with a nice carrying case with a carbon fiber type of shell. Also  my favorite thing about the massage gun is the 15 attachments that it comes with!!! Each attachment is perfectly shaped to contour different parts of your body that you are massaging.Anyway  I began to exercise and this massage gun has helped me recover faster than before I started using the massage gun. I especially like to use the massage gun after  leg day . To anyone that does intense leg days like I do you know how sore you can get. Using the massage gun reduces my pain relief.I highly recommend this massage gun to anyone as it is very relaxing and of great value for the quality you are getting.
Easy and effective massage gun,-,SerenaSheri,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,I bought this massage gun for myself due to the good reviews. It doesn t disappoint. It is very easy to use. The screen has lots of information. I usually use it after a long hike and it really relieve the strain in my muscles. There are many heads to be used at different part of your body. The battery life is great. I haven t used it up after several session.The material is also quite high quality. It s skin friendly when your hold it.Only thing is that it s quite heavy. After holding it for some time  you arm will feel tired.
Best purchase ever!,-,Deborah Beckman,-,5,2020-03-19T13:59:17,This thing is Amazing! Helps us stay more active  less need for pain medication  less headaches  and definitely improves quality of life! Powerful and more gentle when you need. Read the information guide! Follow directions! Over massaging one area might feel great at the time  but you can be sore or bruised the next day if you over do it. Trust me! You ll be surprised how little time you need to get relief. I have chronic pain & 10-20 minutes a day  routinely is life-changing! It took 1-2 hours with traditional massage to get same results. Who has the time? I ve used other massagers too  but not this style or high powered. Wish I found this sooner! I love deep tissue and find better results following the directions and keep changing areas after two minutes  you can always go back to the area after a break. I.e. my shoulders hurt the most  so I start there  hit other areas and go back at the end. Auto shut down (not completely off) is actually great for taking turns and keeping things fair. We love this thing!

It has crazy power...remember those old Brookstone massager that were super weak...this will blow your mind. It s packaged well  would be a great gift for anyone who has a bad back or sore muscles or works out. I love that it shows you how long you ve been using it. There are more attachments than you will ever use. It s a SUPER SOLID and well-made piece of machinery. I can t speak highly enough about it. If you are looking for a solid self-massager  this is the one!
Wonderful Gift!,-,Esther Q.,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ewUNPOxEL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-07-02T17:54:17,I bought this as a gift for my husband who is quite particular about the quality of the brands he uses  so I was a bit worried it might not be up to his standards. Right off the bat  he was pleased with the look and feel of the equipment. Not cheaply made and looks to last. Also  the storage case for the gun and the separate storage case that fits inside for the attachments were very well made so that it is put away neatly. He is very satisfied with the amount of pressure the gun gives and the variations in speed. Overall  we are both very satisfied with this purchase because there are so many options of massage guns and not all are made equal! The price is on point compared to other over priced massage guns!
Love it!,-,Lesa,-,5,2020-06-26T14:59:17,I am so glad I purchased this massage gun. It has helped so much with pain relief in my neck  shoulder  and lower back. I love all the different attachments and how easy it is to change them out. The battery lasts for a very long time and it is very powerful.The only thing I would change is to have a way to hold the attachments in place in the case they came in  but I do like the protective case everything came in.I like the weight of the massage gun. It s heavy enough to feel sturdy but not so heavy it s uncomfortable to use. Thanks for making a great product!
Really solidly built,-,Felix,-,5,2020-09-06T17:39:17,This massage gun comes with a carrying case... and the various attachments come in a carrying case inside the carrying case!It has an impressive weight and build quality that some of the cheaper ones lack. I ve used other massage guns and they sometimes rattle  this one was relatively quiet. Obviously at the higher speeds it gets louder.I put it on max for 10 mins or so  it didn t seem to overheat or slow down. My body was numb afterwards though.Probably my only complaint is that the massage heads should have come with a bag instead of a soft-shell case. It s a little annoying trying to fit the heads back into the case.
Miracle in a massage gun,-,Amanda,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C17jCLrfI3S._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1jdZnutMjS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-09-18T17:59:17,I love this massage gun!! It has been such a lifesaver. I work long days on my feet with a chronic back injury so by the end of the day my muscles are tight and tired and I have slot of muscle spasms  however this massage gun has loosened the knots and relaxed all the tight muscles so I can relax without my muscles going into spasms. I don t know how I ever lived without this  it is well worth the price and I m telling all my coworkers in the operatering room about this amazing product.I find it super user friendly  the attachments are very easy to exchange. There is a built in 10 min shut off timer which I find extremely useful so that you don t lose track of time and stay in one spot for to long  but don t despair you can just change spots and turn it right back on.I am confident that with continued use I am definitely going to see a reduction in my chronic back pain.
Excellent Product!,-,Abby,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818dNiaUFyL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UHWeNQQDL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eCyJOH++L._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hwRAZZiKL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wR3SoomiL._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2wHY9SPL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-05-17T17:59:17,I m really enjoying my new Darkiron massage gun!I bought it to help with my muscle recovery abd with muscle growth. It charged all the way I about an hour. The massage heads are easily removable and they are many for different part of the body.I do like how you can pick your speed and you can get and like the LED display which has the run time indication and power indication as well! Battery life is very decent as well!I tried different attachments and you can definitely feel a difference!
A great overall massage gun!,-,Charles Doan,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1boHVtXpoS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1j8f58OhJS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-08-06T12:59:17,This gun is great! I use it at least every other day. You can use it by yourself or have someone hit you with it.The photo shown is the my favorite attachment. It can literally be used everywhere. They send you a manual with this along with a multitude of attachments and a description of where they can be used.The charging feature is perfect as it lets you know when it s fully charged.I was a bit hesitant to buy this at first  but this was a great purchase decision. Everyone needs to have this. The adjustability of speed makes it that much better as well.
Absolutely does the job,-,Chris,-,5,2020-07-16T12:59:17,I suffer from chronic back pain  which is made much worse when I sleep poorly  and unfortunately with a little one that has been happening frequently. This massager is extremely easy to use  has more than enough power to really get at those muscles. This gun was definitely a deal  and I ve seen similar guns sell for 3-4 times as much  and functionally are the same. All in all a good deal  and very handy when things start to act up.
Best investment EVER!,-,Robyn Hunter,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+TkGsVcES._SY300.jpg,5,2020-01-23T12:59:17,Amazing product! Worth every penny and kind of upset with myself for not finding this ages ago. It s effective and affordable. Great for breaking up tension in your muscles and tendons. Feels amazing! Mine came almost fully charged so that was a nice little surprise  being able to use it right out of the box. It s a little on the heavier side but I like that about it. Best purchase I ve made on Amazon all year  hands down.
This is being KIND to your body!,-,Asya Luedke,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1852DCKwjS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+gwSoeh4S._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1Ei-DmwVVS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1HnE5pSD+S._SY300.jpg,5,2020-09-17T17:59:17,I was in the market for a massage gun for my husband and I. I did some price matching  read a lot of reviews and watched plenty YouTube videos. After juggling with high end brand names and high end prices  I placed my order for the Dark Iron Massage Gun EM31. I gave it to my husband for an early Father s Day gift. He loved it  I loved how many attachments it came with. Other massage guns at a higher price range didn t come with as many as Dark Iron. The weight and feel of the gun itself was impressive  very sturdy and sleek but not too heavy or bulky. My 6 and 1 year old also enjoy “using” it when we take it out. It comes with a portable case with designated spots for the massage gun and charger cord ( which by the way we haven t had to use since receiving it a week ago  while using it everyday.) an a spot for the separate case for all the attachments. The attachments come with a pamphlet about each attachment and what parts of the body they are made for. Overall I m impressed and would buy for others as a gift.
Using it nearly 5 times a week  going strong,-,Jackolantern,-,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,I was pretty hesitant to buy one of these because I wasn t sure how much it would help muscle tension. I stretch and ice but this is the icing on the cake. I would buy this again. it s not loud  which is favorable  it s effective  and after nearly a month of decent use appears reliable.. The explication of the attachments provided is also apt.I ll update again if it s performance dwindles  but so far 5 stars.
New life thanks to good vibrations,-,Utatahn,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vfaMMv7ZL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-03-25T17:59:17,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It was beautifully packaged and very easy to use right out of the box (except for the fact you should charge it before using it). My wife has chronic lower back pain since childbirth and it s exhausting trying to dig in and help relieve her pain through manual massage. This machine is very powerful and has more massage head options then I ever would have thought possible but we were able to find the perfect ones and after only a few minutes daily it has helped her tons!We re a very active family with frequent muscle cramps  soreness  etc and this has been the quickest easiest way to restore  revive  heal  and get back to life quickly.
Heavy Duty,-,Travis H.,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o0qzq2IsL._SY300.jpg,5,2020-08-24T11:59:17,I received this as a gift from my wife. It is very heavy duty which is needed for a percussive massager. The weight provides a balance to the percussive movements so you do not need to hold the massager with two hands to give a great massage. It hits deep knots very well.Honestly so far I ve been very impressed with it. Battery life is off the charts I think I ve only charged it once and everyone has been using it.We definitely gravitate towards the round ball but a few other pieces will hit different parts of your muscles more precisely. Overall this is a great buy and great father s day gift (hint hint).
Great for Tension Migraines,-,M. K. Davis,-,5,2020-05-15T12:59:17,Great for Shoulder Tension!! I struggle with an ongoing injury from my neck which often triggers migraines. So far this has been extremely helpful. Feeling a lot less tension after 2 days of use.All the attachments I haven t tried but do go with the suggestions of area of use in the misc attachments. There are a LOT!Battery life so far is great.Is best used with a partner - might be a bit cumbersome if used on your own for hard to reach areas. And a tad heavy when using by yourself. No excessive vibration for whomever is applying the massager when using which is so nice!
Works great!,-,Janzbooks,-,5,2020-06-18T12:59:17,This is the first massage gun I have purchased and I am very pleased with it. The variety of heads makes it easy to work many places on the body. A lighted ring at the end of the handle indicates when it needs to be recharged. The multiple speed settings are useful. No need to apply any pressure when using the massage gun. Touch it to the body and it does all of the work. After a week of using it  my achy muscles are feeling better.
Nice way to relieve muscle strain,-,PG,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1EINKEt20S._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1SiRgELmiS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,I have a stiff knee and muscles around it after an injury. This machine helps immediately relieve stiffness with low speed setting. It has 3 speed modes  and I felt comfortable with low and medium settings. Battery life was good enough for daily usage. The ergonomics of the design makes it very usable with 1 hand.The unit comes with multiple accessories  and I haven t tried them all as they appear to feel a bit differently depending on where you try it. Fully recommend this.
It's great,-,Leslie Schneider,-,5,2020-09-25T15:59:17,I bought this because I have back problems and have had two surgeries. I ve used it several times and it loosens me up. I have hopes that with continued use  I will only get better. It comes in a nice case and has a LOT of attachments  one for every body part that ails you. It s very easy to use and I like the fact that it s variable speed and has a count-down timer. I ve had some success using it on my own back since I know being massaged by someone else can be tiring for them. But I used it on my wife s back last night and she fell asleep. I think it s the first time she s been relaxed since the pandemic.
I can massage my back!,One person found this helpful,Seraph,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1d7AlMIyZS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1vBH0PvLYS._SY300.jpg     ;     https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1eFw2VlbRS._SY300.jpg,5,2020-04-17T17:59:17,Wow! First of all  the same day delivery is greatly appreciated! Working from home  working out from home  playing Tennis randomly and dealing with the pandemic  My back have been super achy with that dull feeling. My lower back has been a pain! Today was extra painful and my daily activity became a choir. My co worker recommended this product and I noticed Amazon offered it same day delivery. I m more amazed at how the massage gun felt on my lower back. It came charged and ready to go. The multiple attachments give so many options. I really recommend this product! I pressed really hard on my lower back and this massage gun did not slow down. The attachments are soft to the feel. Not sure how long this battery will last. So far so good! Highly recommend!
Well built  heavy duty massage gun. Excellent choice among others.,One person found this helpful,BrianK,-,5,2020-02-18T17:23:17,After researching massage guns  I decided on this one based on positive reviews and feature. The gun is large and heavy  feeling very well made. Fully charged  this thing keeps on going. Great control over speed. Being a runner  I bought this to help with sore leg muscles. This gun is a perfect choice. All the additional tips are great for other areas of the body. I was surprised with the amount of pain relief from the very first treatment. Come with a very nice carrying case. My friend bought a cheaper version and this one works so much better. Will recommend to my running friends and look forward to muscle relief after running. Quick shipping and easy to use.
Broken/Doesn’t turn off,3 people found this helpful,P. Bova,-,1,2020-09-18T17:59:17,Used it twice before the on/off button broke. Now when I turn it to the off position it doesn t do anything and is stuck powered on. A shame because it comes in a nice case and is powerful.
Great bang for the Buck,-,Josh,-,5,2020-09-29T17:59:17,I ve been keeping an eye out for a massage gun ever since the craze started a few years ago. I m in my mid 30s  I play rugby  and I lift weights to stay in shape. So a tool such as this would get lots of use from me.I was skeptical at best when I looked to find a good massage gun that wasn t going to cost me 400+ dollars. I did my research  but that didn t seem to help much. I finally looked through the reviews for this one and a couple others around the same price range. I own a nice collection of power tools and am familiar with BRUSHLESS technology and why it s important to the longevity of the product and it s benefits for the user.With all of this said  I was still certain that this massage gun was not going to live up to it s 400$ counterparts  but as I was able to get it on sale  I figured that it couldn t hurt to try it out...I got to say  it exceeded my expectations. Is it as good as one that costs 4x more? I m not sure  before I bought it I would have said no; now  I ve been so impressed with this massager  that I m not sure what more money would have actually bought me. Maybe there are more bells and whistles  though with it s litany of massage heads and variations in speeds  I m not sure what else there would be to add on. Maybe the life of the product would be better  but I know quality  and this does hit that mark too.So in conclusion  while I cannot say that I believe this to be the best massage gun on the market  mostly because I don t have enough experience with others. I can say that I am extremely happy with my purchase and have already recommended it to others with similar needs to my own. If you are on the fence about this  I d recommend trying it out. At the price  I can t imagine you will get anything better.
Powerful and nice attachments,4 people found this helpful,Ryan,-,4,2020-04-23T14:12:17,Overall a nice purchase. Powerful  but hard to hold. The attachments are just kind of thrown into the bag and it looks sloppy. The $50  bonus  for a review is a little sketchy  but I ll take it. I will follow up if the bonus is actually bogus.
It works as good as it looks,-,Robb,-,5,2020-02-22T16:59:17,I love this massager. As soon as you hold it in your hand it feels like quality. It has a slight soft rubber feel to it which is nice considering that the whole thing vibrates. The LED panel is quite functional and provides all data you would like (remaining battery  vibration strength  friend 15 minute timer). It s very strong as well. I will push it up against my leg muscle and it won t slow down the motor. The case is very nice. Although the case is very attractive  it is a bit flimsy. A dozen attachments are included for various massaging parts of your body  but I catch myself just using the cushioned round ball 100% of the time. There is a smaller case included for the accessories that will store nicely inside the larger case (which is very thoughtful). Battery life is fantastic! Overall  I m very happy with the unit and have no problem recommending it to anyone.
Not worth the price  painful,3 people found this helpful,KC,-,1,2020-01-18T17:53:17,This purchase was a disappointment. Don t buy. There are better guns out there for the same price. I was Hoping this would relieve my achy muscles but I feel More damaged after using it. There s only one setting which is too aggressive. I can Feel my internal organs vibrating when using this. It only causes more pain! Feel like I m being hit with a baseball bat. Sucks.
Great for feet,One person found this helpful,V. Lea,-,4,2020-07-23T17:59:17,Battery holds a charge well so far  and if turned off with the power switch on the base it can be days between charges.My favorite use for this is hand and feet massages  with the thumb shaped attachment. It is not as nice as the $300 name brand one I sampled at a store for shoulder pain. But it s also not $300. It was used by someone else who is prone to calf pain and he does feel that it helps with that and when he exercises.

I can only do lowest. The 2nd setting on my lower back. You will need someone to help you with it. I have hand weakness due to MS and carpal tunnel. I am hoping that this will help with some pain that I have from walking oddly. Do not press hard on yourself let it work you. The only soft one is the ball . Which is the one I like best so far.
Broken on first use,3 people found this helpful,Farwell,-,1,2020-08-01T17:23:17,Bought the product to use mostly on arms and legs post workout. However  upon first use after about 8 mins of use  the massage gun started clicking due to what sounded like the motor or whatever system keeps the adjustable heads moving. I returned the item. Hopefully just a defect of a singular item as all of the adjustable heads seemed like they would do a lot of good.
This product lives up to all that it promises,-,Amazon Customer,-,5,2020-08-22T17:59:17,It s always a pleasure when you make a purchase that exceeds your expectations. I recently had arthoscopic surgery on my shoulder to mend rotator cuff tear and ended up with having to have the bicep cut on the same arm. To say that my muscles were tight post surgery and throughout rehab is an understatement. When I spoke to my surgeon about the tightness throughout my back and medial deltoid  he recommended deep tissue message OR to purchase a deep tissue massage gun. I took his advice and went for the later and I felt relief after the first time I used it. This product will be a part of my keeping an active lifestyle with less discomfort from here on out.

I had been thinking about picking one up for a while now and after comparing several models I finally pulled the trigger. With 15 different attachments I have no problem finding one to work out a knot or my sore muscles. I love using the massage gun to help my recovery from a hard workout or after one of my backpacking trips.

It s VERY simple to use and so easy to store! My husband is in Jujitsu and I am in Taekwondo. This breaks up our tense muscles and helps us relax so much. We are prone to aches due to work and training and this has been such a life saver to get a deep tissue massage in target spots. 100% recommended!!!!!
An actual life changer,-,Kevin Young,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,I m not a reviewer  but needed to make it known that this thing is honestly life changing. I ve been suffering with some wrist pain and forearm discomfort and while waiting for a doctors appointment got this one dayed to my door. This thing is a life saver. Working out the muscles in my wrist  arms and even back and shoulders have relieved so much discomfort that I d buy it again in a heart beat. It comes with a handful of attachments and the battery life has been great. Probably used about an hour or massaging and just charged it for the first time this morning. Do yourself a favor and get one even if you don t need it now. It s worth it ten times over.
AMAZING,-,nadaal,-,5,2020-08-01T17:23:17,I receive it after two days from doing the order  this massage gun is awesome  it comes in a nice bag with lots of different extensions to use in another small bag  these heads let you massage every corner of your body  with very easy and clear manual to read  it s so easy to use and helped me with my back pain.I highly recommended this massage gun to anyone who has pain anywhere throughout their body.
Broke less than a week after purchase,-,Wolfe,-,1,2020-09-25T15:59:17,We were initially thrilled with the bang for the buck but less than a week into light use the attachment point ejected from the device and several screws fell out. Pretty sure I could repair it but that s not really the point  a little bit of thread lock would have made this device a home run.
Best Massager to carry around!,-,Max Sol,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B17mpXTVA0S._SY300.jpg,5,2020-04-15T17:59:17,Easy to use out of the box. Came with its own very sturdy case. Able to use it right away. Battery life last for over a week now with me using it daily. Relieves pain in any part of your body since it came with 15 attachments heads.The good thing is it s not so heavy so you reach almost any part of your body and because it s handy  your can carry it around for travel. Great product for the price!!
Dead Simple and Powerful!,-,Jacob,-,5,2020-05-22T11:59:17,This device has been a welcome relief to family. Who needs a massage therapist when you have this wonderful device? It has plenty of power and speed. Just when you think you understand how it works  you find another tip that changes the way it works and feels. This will fix or address any issue you are running into!

Best massage gun I've tried so far!,-,Matthew D,-,5,2020-07-23T17:59:17,I was skeptical of purchasing a massage gun that wasn t made by the  big names  but this one is great. It can go slow enough to be a gentle massage but fast enough to work the muscles. The many different massage heads was nice as well. I d recommend this one. The price was right and it seems to be a quality product too. 5 Stars!
